## ADC_DMA_Multi_Channel example<a name="catalogue"></a>


### 1 Brief
The function of this code is to collect the voltage on channel 1 and channel 7 of ADC through DMA, and display the digital amount of the voltage converted by ADC and the analog amount converted by ADC on the serial port debugging assistant.
### 2 Hardware Hookup
The hardware resources used in this experiment are:
+ LED - PA8
+ USART1 - PA9\PA10
+ ADC1 - Channel1(PA1)
+ ADC1 - Channel7(PA7)

The ADC used in this experiment is an on-chip resource of STM32H503, so there is no corresponding connection schematic.

### 3 STM32CubeIDE Configuration


We copy the previous chapter project and name both the project and the.ioc file **15_3_ADC_DMA_Multi_Channel**.Next we start the ADC configuration by double-clicking the **15_3_ADC_DMA_Multi_Channel.ioc** file.

Next, configure the pin of the ADC1 channel first. In this experiment, we use the input channel 1\2\3\4\5\6\7 of ADC1,and configure each channel of ADC1 as a single-ended input mode, as shown in the figure below:

Since this experiment uses one more ADC channel than the experiment in the previous chapter, the ADC channel needs to be reconfigured.
Click **Analog > ADC1** to set.

Next are the ADC1 parameters, as shown in the following screenshot.

Click **File > Save**, and you will be asked to generate code.Click **Yes**.

The code for the ADC and DMA is the same as in the previous chapter, but we have already covered them and will not repeat them here.

###### main.c
Here's the code in the main function.
```c#
/* USER CODE BEGIN PV */
#define ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE      2 * 50             /* ADC DMA buffer size */
static uint16_t g_adc_dma_buf[ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE]; /* ADC DMA buffer */

extern uint8_t g_adc_dma_sta; /* DMA transfer completion flag */
/* USER CODE END PV */
int main(void)
{
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 1 */

    uint16_t i;
    uint8_t j;
    uint32_t sum;
    uint16_t adcdata;
    uint16_t voltage;

  /* USER CODE END 1 */

  /* MCU Configuration--------------------------------------------------------*/

  /* Reset of all peripherals, Initializes the Flash interface and the Systick. */
  HAL_Init();

  /* USER CODE BEGIN Init */

  /* USER CODE END Init */

  /* Configure the system clock */
  SystemClock_Config();

  /* USER CODE BEGIN SysInit */

  /* USER CODE END SysInit */

  /* Initialize all configured peripherals */
  MX_GPIO_Init();
  MX_DMA_Init();
  MX_USART1_UART_Init();
  MX_ADC1_Init();
  /* USER CODE BEGIN 2 */

  stm32f103c8t6_show_mesg();
  HAL_DMA_Start_IT(&hdma_adc1, (uint32_t)&ADC1->DR, (uint32_t)&g_adc_dma_buf, 0);	/* Start DMA and enable interrupt */
  HAL_ADC_Start_DMA(&hadc1, (uint32_t*)&g_adc_dma_buf, 0);           				/* Turn on the ADC and transmit the result via DMA */

  adc_dma_enable(ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE);   												/* Start ADC DMA acquisition */
  /* USER CODE END 2 */

  /* Infinite loop */
  /* USER CODE BEGIN WHILE */
  while (1)
  {
      if (g_adc_dma_sta == 1)                             	/* Wait for the DMA transfer to end */
      {
          for (j = 0; j < 7; j++)                         	/* Traversal processing of 7 channels of data */
          {
              sum = 0;

              for (i = 0; i < (ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE / 7); i++)	/* The multiple sampling values of the ADC are averaged */
              {
                  sum += g_adc_dma_buf[(7 * i) + j];
              }

              adcdata = sum / (ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE / 7);
              printf("\r\n original value[%d]ï¼š%d\r\n", j + 1, adcdata);

              voltage = (adcdata * 3300) / 4095;          	/* Calculate the actual voltage value (1000x enlargement) */
              printf("\r\nvoltage[%d]:%d.%d\r\n", j + 1, voltage / 1000, voltage % 1000);

              g_adc_dma_sta = 0;                          	/* Clear the DMA transfer end flag */
              adc_dma_enable(ADC_DMA_BUF_SIZE);           	/* Enable the next DMA transmission of ADC data */
          }
      }

	  LED_TOGGLE();       								  	/* LED state is flipped */
	  HAL_Delay(100);
    /* USER CODE END WHILE */

    /* USER CODE BEGIN 3 */
  }
  /* USER CODE END 3 */
}
```
The code in this section is very similar to that in the previous chapter.The data for DMA transfers are stored in the **g_adc_dma_buf** array-two channels are used in this case, so a larger DMA transfer destination memory is required. Each channel uses 50 uint16_t of space for the ADC data. To reduce error, we take the average of the data in the array.


### 4 Running
#### 4.1 Compile & Download
After the compilation is complete, connect the DAP and the Mini Board, and then connect to the computer together to download the program to the development board.
#### 4.2 Phenomenon
Press the reset button to restart the development board, observe the LED flashing on the development board, open the serial port and the host computer ATK-XCOM can see the prompt information of the experiment, indicating that the code download is successful. When the dupont line is used to connect the **PA1** and **PA7** pins with different voltage values, the digital and analog voltage of the serial port host computer will also change. **It should be noted that the input voltage cannot exceed the 3.3V threshold of the development board**, otherwise it may damage the development board. The phenomenon is illustrated in the following figure:
